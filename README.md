# MP3.-Tag-Reader-Editor
The MP3 Tag Reader and Editor is a C-based file-parsing application designed to extract and modify ID3v1 metadata embedded in MP3 files. The system reads the last 128 bytes of an audio file, interprets fields such as Title, Artist, Album, Year, and Comment, and allows controlled editing without affecting the audio stream.
